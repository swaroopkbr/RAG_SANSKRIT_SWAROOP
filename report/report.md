# 1. Introduction

This project focuses on building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed specifically for answering queries from a collection of Sanskrit documents.

The complete system is implemented to run fully on **CPU-based inference**, ensuring it can work efficiently without requiring GPU acceleration.

RAG systems combine two key components:

- **Retriever** → Finds relevant text passages  
- **Generator** → Produces an answer grounded in retrieved context  

This approach improves factual correctness and reduces hallucinations compared to standalone language models.

# 2. System Architecture and Flow

## 2.1 Overall Workflow

The Sanskrit RAG pipeline follows this structured flow:

1. Load Sanskrit documents from the dataset directory  
2. Clean and split documents into smaller chunks  
3. Convert chunks into semantic embeddings  
4. Store embeddings inside a FAISS vector index  
5. Accept user queries from the command line  
6. Retrieve the most relevant chunks using similarity search  
7. Construct a prompt using query + retrieved context  
8. Generate the final answer using a lightweight LLM  
9. Display response along with source evidence  

---

## 2.2 Modular Architecture

The project is designed in two main execution modules:

---

### ✅ A. Indexing Module (Offline Stage)

**File:** `build_index.py`

This module prepares the retrieval system before runtime:

- Loads all Sanskrit `.txt` documents from `/data`  
- Applies chunking for better semantic retrieval  
- Generates embeddings for each chunk  
- Builds a FAISS vector database  
- Saves the index to disk for later use  

> This stage is executed once during setup.

---

### ✅ B. Query Module (Online Stage)

**File:** `query.py`

This module performs real-time question answering:

- Loads the prebuilt FAISS index  
- Converts the user query into embedding space  
- Retrieves top-k relevant chunks using similarity search + MMR  
- Passes the context into the generator model  
- Prints final answer with supporting sources  

---

# 3. Sanskrit Document Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of multiple Sanskrit stories and subhashitas stored in `.txt` format inside the `/data/` folder.

### 📄 Documents Included

| File Name            | Content Description |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| `murkhabhritya.txt` | Story of Shankhnad (मूर्खभृत्यस्य) |
| `devbhakta.txt`     | Story on devotion and effort (देवभक्तः कथा) |
| `ghantakarna.txt`   | Story of Ghantakarna (घण्टाकर्णः कथा) |
| `kalidasa.txt`      | Clever Kalidasa story (चतुरस्य कालीदासस्य) |
| `sheetam.txt`       | Short story about cold hardships (शीतं बहु बाधति) |

Each document is stored separately to reduce retrieval confusion and improve grounding quality.

# 4. Sanskrit Document Preprocessing Pipeline

Efficient preprocessing is essential since Sanskrit text often contains complex structure and long sentences.

---

## 4.1 Document Loading

The system loads text files using:

- `DirectoryLoader`  
- `TextLoader(encoding="utf-8")`

UTF-8 encoding ensures correct processing of Devanagari characters.

---

## 4.2 Chunking Strategy

Since large documents cannot fit directly into LLM context windows, documents are split into smaller pieces using:

✅ `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`

### Configuration

- `chunk_size = 350` characters  
- `chunk_overlap = 50` characters  

Chunk overlap helps maintain sentence continuity across boundaries.

---

## 4.3 Embedding Generation

To enable semantic retrieval, each chunk is converted into an embedding vector using:

✅ `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`

### Reasons for Selection

- Lightweight and CPU-efficient  
- Strong multilingual performance  
- Suitable for Sanskrit/Hindi-style scripts  

---

# 5. Retrieval and Generation Mechanisms

---

## 5.1 Retriever Component

### ✅ Vector Store

The system uses:

✅ **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**  

FAISS enables fast and memory-efficient similarity search on CPU.

---

### ✅ Retrieval Strategy

The retriever applies:

✅ **MMR (Max Marginal Relevance)**

### Advantages

- Retrieves relevant and diverse passages  
- Avoids redundant repeated context  
- Improves answer grounding  

---

## 5.2 Generator Component

### ✅ Language Model Used

The answer generation is performed using:

✅ `google/flan-t5-small`

### Reasons

- Small model suitable for CPU inference  
- Faster response time  
- Effective for QA-style generation tasks  

---

### ✅ Prompt Design

A constrained prompt template is applied so that:

- Answers are produced only from retrieved context  
- If the context lacks the answer, the model returns:

```text
सन्दर्भे उत्तरं न लभ्यते।
```

# 6. Performance Observations
## 6.1 Latency
Component	Approximate Time
FAISS Retrieval	< 1 second
LLM Answer Generation	Few seconds (CPU dependent)

Retrieval remains extremely fast even on basic machines.

## 6.2 Resource Usage

The system operates entirely without GPU.

Main memory usage comes from:

Embedding model loading

FAISS index storage

FLAN-T5 inference overhead

Using flan-t5-small keeps RAM usage minimal.

## 6.3 Retrieval Accuracy / Relevance

System accuracy depends mainly on retrieval quality.

Improvements Observed

Story-wise file separation reduces wrong context mixing

MMR increases relevance diversity

Example

Query: शंखनादः कः?
Correctly retrieved from murkhabhritya.txt

Generated response:

शंखनादः गोवर्धनदासस्य भृत्यः अस्ति।


This demonstrates strong retrieval grounding and accurate generation.

# 7. Conclusion
